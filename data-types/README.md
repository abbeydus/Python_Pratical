Data-types
There are different types of data types in Python. Some built-in Python data types are:

Numeric data types: int, float, complex
String data types: str
Sequence types: list, tuple, range
Binary types: bytes, bytearray
Mapping data type: dict
Boolean type: bool
Set data types: set, frozenset
Numeric Data type
int - holds signed integers of non-limited length.
float- holds floating precision numbers and itâ€™s accurate up to 15 decimal places.
complex- holds complex numbers.
String Data type
The string is a sequence of characters. Python supports Unicode characters. Generally, strings are represented by either single or double-quotes

List Data type
The list is a versatile data type exclusive in Python.It can simultaneously hold different types of data.

a= [1,2,3,4,5,6]
print(a)
Tuple
The tuple is another data type which is a sequence of data similar to a list. But it is immutable. That means data in a tuple is write-protected. Data in a tuple is written using parenthesis and commas.

Dictionary
Python Dictionary is an unordered sequence of data of key-value pair form. It is similar to the hash table type. Dictionaries are written within curly braces in the form key:value. It is very useful to retrieve data in an optimized way among a large amount of data.
