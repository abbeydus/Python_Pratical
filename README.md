Variables
In Python, a variable is a symbolic name that represents or refers to a value. Variables are used to store data that can be manipulated and referenced in a program. Unlike some other programming languages, Python does not require explicit declaration of variables or their data types. You can simply assign a value to a variable, and Python will automatically determine the data type.

Here's a simple example:

python
Copy code
# Assigning a value to a variable
x = 5

# Printing the value of the variable
print(x)
In this example, x is a variable, and 5 is the value assigned to it. The print statement then displays the value of the variable.

Key points about Python variables:

Dynamic Typing: Python is dynamically typed, meaning that the data type of a variable is determined at runtime. You can reassign a variable to a value of a different type without explicitly specifying the type.

python
Copy code
x = 5       # x is an integer
x = "hello" # x is now a string
Variable Names: Variable names in Python can contain letters (both uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and underscores. They must start with a letter or an underscore. Python follows the snake_case naming convention, where variable names are lowercase and words are separated by underscores.

python
Copy code
my_variable = 10
Assignment: The assignment operator = is used to assign a value to a variable.

Reassignment: You can change the value of a variable by assigning it a new value.

python
Copy code
x = 5
print(x)  # Output: 5

x = 10
print(x)  # Output: 10
Multiple Assignments: You can assign values to multiple variables in a single line.

python
Copy code
a, b, c = 1, 2, 3
Constants: While Python doesn't have a built-in constant type, it is a convention to use uppercase names for variables that should be treated as constants (values that should not be changed).

python
Copy code
PI = 3.14
Variables play a crucial role in programming, allowing you to store and manipulate data in your code. Understanding how to use variables effectively is fundamental to writing Python programs.
